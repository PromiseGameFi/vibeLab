# Marketing & Usability Strategy: VibeLab

## The Core Problem
**AI Fragmentation & Prompt Fatigue.** Users have access to 10+ powerful models but:
1. They don't know the **Pro-Parameters** (e.g., `--sref`, `--cw`) that separate a "toy" result from a "pro" result.
2. They don't know how to **Chain** tools (e.g., "How do I get my Midjourney character into a Kling video?").
3. They waste time "tinkering" instead of "shipping".

## The Solution: "The AI Blueprint"
VibeLab will be positioned not as a list, but as a **recipe book** for specific outcomes.

### 1. "Goal-First" Navigation (UX)
- **Problem**: Users search for "Kling" (Tool-First).
- **Usability Lift**: Users should search for "Consistent Character Video" (Goal-First).
- **Implementation**: Map every tool and workflow to "Goal Keywords".

### 2. The "Chain" Visualizer
- **Problem**: Text lists of integrations look like links, not processes.
- **Usability Lift**: A visual "Node-based" layout (CSS-based) for Tool Chains.
- **Implementation**: Update `[slug]/page.tsx` to use a more diagram-like UI.

### 3. "Copy/Paste to Pro" One-Click
- **Problem**: Copying a prompt is one thing; understanding *why* it works is another.
- **Usability Lift**: Annotate prompts (e.g., "This part handles the lighting, this part handles the physics").

## Marketing Hook
**"Stop prompting. Start stacking."**
- Focus on "Stacking" as the new high-skill ceiling for AI artists.
- Position VibeLab as the authoritative source for these stacks.

## Growth Channels (For Visits)
1. **Tool-Specific SEO**: Rank for "Kling Pro Tips" or "Midjourney --sref guide".
2. **Social "Recipes"**: Share "AI Recipes" on X/Twitter and LinkedIn (e.g., "How to build a 3D character in 3 steps with VibeLab").
3. **Open-Source manual**: Invite users to submit their "stacks" (Future feature).
