## AI Tool Guides

### Vibecode & Vibe Coding
- **Advanced Workflow**: "Vibe PMing" - Use AI to generate a full README.md and technical design document *before* any code.
- **Tip**: Modular refinement. Refactor file-by-file to keep context clean.
- **Debugger**: Invoke "Debug Voice" to ask the AI to explain architectural failures.

### Kling (Video)
- **Advanced Workflow**: FORMS formula (Focus, Outcome, Realism, Motion, Setting).
- **Control**: Use Motion Brush for sub-frame animation control.
- **Consistency**: Elements feature - upload up to 4 images to lock in character faces and costumes.

### Midjourney (Image)
- **Parameters**: `--sref` (Style Reference) with weight codes. `--p` (Personalization) for unique style learning.
- **Realism**: `--style raw` and `--v 6.1` for pure photographic output.
- **Character**: `--cref` for consistent faces across generations.

### Cursor (IDE)
- **Advanced Workflow**: `.cursorrules` for project scaffolding.
- **Tip**: Use '@Codebase' to force the AI to index the entire project before answering complex technical questions.
- **Power Feature**: Composer (Cmd+I) for multi-file feature implementation.

### Luma Dream Machine (Video)
- **Advanced Workflow**: Keyframe interpolation. Set Start/End frames to dictate transitions.
- **Tip**: Loop prompts for 360 world assets or infinite textures.

### Flux.1 (Image)
- **Advanced Workflow**: Layered prompting (Foreground -> Mid-ground -> Background).
- **Tip**: Natural language is better than weights. MJ weights don't work here.
- **Power Feature**: Perfect text rendering for posters, UI, and signage.
