# VibeLab

> **Build better AI workflows, faster**

---

## Vision

VibeLab is the hub for **AI tool optimization**:
- Security Scanner for GitHub repos
- Universal AI Memory across all tools
- Pro blueprints for AI tools
- Universal skills for coding agents

---

## The 4 Pillars

### 1. Security Scanner (`/scan`) ✅
Enterprise-grade vulnerability scanning.
- 218+ patterns across 6 categories
- GitHub OAuth for private repos
- AI-powered fix suggestions (Gemini)
- Export: JSON, SARIF, Markdown

### 2. AI Memory (`/memory`) ✅
Persistent context that works across ALL AI tools.

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Dashboard | View, search, export memories |
| Browser Extension | Auto-capture from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini |
| MCP Server | Access memories from Cursor/Claude Desktop |

**Token Optimization:**
- Budget slider (500-8000 tokens)
- Auto-summarization (10x compression)
- Tiered storage (Hot/Warm/Cold)

### 3. Tool Directory ✅
Pro blueprints for AI tools: Cursor, Midjourney, Kling, Flux, ElevenLabs, etc.
- Annotated prompts with explanations
- Recommended workflows
- Tool integrations

### 4. Universal Skills (`/skills`) ✅
Coding rules that work across AI agents.
- Export to: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Antigravity
- One skill → Works everywhere
