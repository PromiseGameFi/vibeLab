We are building VibeLab.

It is a specialized web directory and guide for AI tools + universal skills.

The Core Concept
Most lists just give you a link to the tool. Your site is different because it teaches people how to use the tool AND provides exportable skills.

We are building a "Manual + Skill Library" for the AI era.

## The 3 Main Parts

### 1. The Tool Directory (Home)
A clean list of powerful AI tools like Vibecode, Kling, and Midjourney.
- A search bar to find them quickly.
- Pro Tips, Best Prompts, and Workflows for each tool.

### 2. Universal Skills (/skills)
Skills that can be exported to any AI coding agent.

#### Coding Skills
- Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, REST APIs, Git
- Export to: Cursor, Claude Code, Antigravity, Codex, Windsurf, Cline

#### Marketing Skills (/skills/marketing)
The AI-powered marketing suite (formerly VibeMarket):

**SMM Toolkit:**
- Thread Studio: AI thread builder
- Posting Planner: Visual calendar
- Evergreen Vault: Content recycler
- Personality Profiles: Voice presets
- Engagement Scorecard: Gamified tracker
- Browser Agent: Automation scripts

**Strategy Tools:**
- Go-To-Market Strategy Generator
- Marketing Strategy Templates (SaaS, Creator, E-commerce, Agency, Dev Tools)
- Custom Marketing Builder (sentiment-based personalization)

### 3. The Connection
The site focuses on interoperability. You are showing users how to:
- Chain AI tools together to build full projects
- Use skills across different coding agents
- Build marketing strategies tailored to their brand

## The User Experience

**Tool User:**
A user struggles to get good video from Kling. They go to your site and type /kling. They immediately see a list of settings and prompts that fix their problem.

**Developer:**
A developer wants consistent coding standards. They browse /skills, find "TypeScript Strict Mode", and export it to their Cursor IDE.

**Marketer:**
A founder needs a go-to-market strategy. They go to /skills/marketing, input their product sentiment, and get a personalized marketing framework.
