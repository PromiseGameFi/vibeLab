We are building VibeStack (or whichever "Vibe" name you choose).

It is a specialized web directory and guide for AI tools.

The Core Concept
Most lists just give you a link to the tool. Your site is different because it teaches people how to use the tool.

We are building a "Manual" for the AI era.

The 3 Main Parts
The Directory (Home)

A clean list of powerful AI tools like Vibecode, Kling, and Midjourney.

A search bar to find them quickly.

The "Cheat Sheet" Pages

Every tool gets its own dedicated URL, like localhost:3000/vibecode.

On this page, you do not just describe the tool. You list:

Pro Tips: "Do this, don't do that."

Best Prompts: Exact text to copy/paste.

Workflows: "Use this tool first, then send the output to Kling."

The Connection

The site focuses on interoperability. You are showing users how to chain these tools together to build full projects (e.g., "Code the UI with Vibecode, generate the assets with Midjourney").

The User Experience
A user struggles to get good video from Kling. They go to your site and type /kling. They immediately see a list of settings and prompts that fix their problem.

It is a knowledge base for builders.

## NEW: Universal Skills (localhost:3000/skills)

A skill marketplace for AI coding agents.

### The Problem
Every AI coding agent has its own format:
- Cursor: `.cursorrules`
- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md`
- Antigravity: `.agent/workflows/`
- Codex: System prompts
- Windsurf: `.windsurfrules`
- Cline: `.clinerules`

### The Solution
VibeLab provides a **Universal Skill Format** that:
1. Creates once → Exports to any agent format
2. Portable → Works in Cursor, Claude Code, Antigravity, etc.
3. Shareable → Community skill marketplace

### Features
- **Skill Directory**: Browse skills by category (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Testing, AI/ML)
- **Skill Creator**: Build custom skills with instructions, rules, and examples
- **Export**: Download as `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, or workflows
- **Community**: Share and discover skills from other developers
